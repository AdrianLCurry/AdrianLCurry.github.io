							<h2 class="bloggy">Starting My Journey to Becoming a Data Analyst</h2>
							<p>The challenge of  choosing a new career path has been finding a way to make my past experiences relevant to a new role. I have poured tons of time into networking, job searching, and keyword matching to find the role that aligned with the skills I possess. </p>
							
							<p>The result? I found myself diving deeper and deeper into Data Analytics.</p>

							<p>So, in August, I dove head-first into learning data analytics. LinkedIn Learning had a data analytics course called "Becoming a Data Analyst." Although the Google Data Analytics course was very popular at the time, I stuck with the LinkedIn course because it fit my schedule really well. The course took just over a month to complete, and I began to map out next steps. I watched every, single TikTok video posted by Annie Nelson(@anniesanalytics) because she'd just secured her first official DA role. I also scoured LinkedIn pages looking for the most ideal ways to begin learning SQL and visualization tools, like Tableau and Power BI. The most important thing I learned at this point: There is no need to try to recreate the wheel. I will be following the path that so many have successfully completed.  </p>
							
							<p>
								<h3>Here's My Roadmap So Far (will be updated frequently): </h3>
								<ol type="1">
									<li>Completed LinkedIn Course: Becoming a Data Analyst</li>
									<li>Created Tableau Public and Azure Data Studio profiles, and refocused my GitHub for Data Analytics</li>
									<li>Completed Alex the Analyst's SQL and Tableau projects on Youtube</li>
									<li>Followed Alex the Analyst's Portfolio video on Youtube to start my portfolio</li>
									<li>Updated my portfolio with Home, Projects, Blog, and Resource pages</li>
									<li>Launch just my Blog page and began posting consistent TikTok and LinkedIn content</li>
									<li>Begin using sites like Maven Analytics and Kaggle to find datasets for full projects</li>
								</ol>

							<h2 class="bloggy">Focus. Focus. Focus. Your Network.</h2>
							<p>All I see now on my LinkedIn is "data" this and "data" that...AND I LOVE IT!</p>
							<p> I have been faithful to LinkedIn for quite some time now. In fact, I was able to secure the role I currently have because of my LinkedIn connections. However, now that I am in search of a new role, two things have become abundantly clear: Focus your networking to individuals in your desired field and never stop learning.</p>

							<p> Nearly two years ago now, I set out to build a network that could aid me in beating the frustrations of the job search. I connected with some amazing recruiters like Amy Miller and the Job Search Angels, and even won a contest to have a free resume written. With that network, and the actual resume from the contest, I was able to get the Accounting Clerk role I have now. So, when beginning to build a network aimed at securing a Data Analyst role, I started out just as before. I connected with some active, resourceful, and really cool recruiters. Following trend, my next step was creating a #newconnections post from which I actually recieved hundreds of new connections. However, I began to see a real pivot when I focused my follows and connections to individuals who were pursuing or already employed in the field of data analytics.</p>
							
							<p>What surprised me most was the constant flow of relevant, 100% usable resources I found every time I opened my LinkedIn feed. Cheatsheets, beginner project videos, portfolio tips, informative live sessions, book suggestions, and daily tidbits for learning the necessary coding languages. There were free templates for all things job search and networking. And the most invaluable resource: Tons of employed Data Analysts sharing their expertise and experience for the benefit of those looking to break into the field.</p>

							<p>I was able to get new resume templates (one of which did cost $10), 2 of my first full projects, and a portfolio template just by focusing my network. I reviewed several GitHub pages of individuals I followed to understand how best to organize mine. I have also been compiling a list of interview questions and resources that I look forward to sharing very soon.</p>

							<p>So Adrian, what's the point? Why have you dragged networking across three paragraphs? The point is that following the people who have come before is saving me both time and money. There will be plenty of time to be different, to be the exception. Until then, use the experience of others to pave a smoother path.</p>
